I am a Visiting Associate Professor at the [Department of Statistics](http://www.estadistica.ucr.ac.cr/), [University of Costa Rica](http://www.ucr.ac.cr/). I graduated from [Iowa State University](http://www.stat.iastate.edu/) in May 2009 with a Master of Science in Statistics and in 2017 from the [North Carolina State University](http://www.stat.ncsu.edu/), in Raleigh, with a Ph.D. in Statistics. 

## Research Interests:

I'm interested in developing novel statistical methods to address scientific questions related to the environment. My applications areas include climate, weather forecast and veterinary. My dissertation was about spatialtemporal modeling, variable selection and Bayesian model averaging, but I have also worked in other projects applying non-spatial variable selection methods, functional data analysis and other tools to construct and evaluate forecasting models.


Since 2014 I've been part of the NCSU Tropical Cyclone Outlook team from the [Coastal Fluid Lab](http://cfdl.meas.ncsu.edu/). We release a yearly TC Outlook to the media. My work in this case goes from collecting the data, to constructing and evaluating the forecast models, to talking to the media when the outlook is released.
