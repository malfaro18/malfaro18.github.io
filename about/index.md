I am a Visiting Associate... PhD student in the Department of Statistics at NC State University. I graduated from Iowa State University in May 2009 with a Master of Science in Statistics and in 2007 from the University of Costa Rica with a Bachelor of Science in Statistics. 

## Research Interests:

I'm interested in developing novel statistical methods to address scientific questions related to the environment. My applications areas include climate, weather forecast and veterinary. My dissertation is about spatialtemporal modeling, variable selection and Bayesian model averaging, but I have also worked in other projects applying non-spatial variable selection methods, functional data analysis and other tools to construct and evaluate forecasting models.


Since 2014 I've been part of the NCSU Tropical Cyclone Outlook team from the Coastal Fluid Lab (http://cfdl.meas.ncsu.edu/). We release a yearly TC Outlook to the media. My work in this case goes from collecting the data, to constructing and evaluating the forecast models, to talking to the media when the outlook is released.

## My advisors are:
